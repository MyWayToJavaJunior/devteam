=======

My first web project named "Development team".

Task:
A customer determines a specification. Required features, developers quantity and qualification are defined in specification. Team manager considers the specification and produces a project. Manager makes a decision about what unengaged developers of required qualification should work at  this project. Project's total cost is calculated by manager. Manager produces a total bill and sends it to the customer. 
The developer has opportunity to mark the number of hours spent for operation over the project.
